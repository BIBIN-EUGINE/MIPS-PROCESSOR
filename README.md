# MIPS-PROCESSOR

The aim of this project is to design a simple pipelined processor i.e. 32-bit five stage processor based on
RISC architecture. The Mini-MIPS uses 3 instruction formats (R, I and J-types) The Mini-MIPS processor is
designed to perform 10 MIPS instructions.

In this project, knowledge about various MIPS instructions, their instruction format and addressing,
instruction data path, control module function and design theory based on RISC CPU instruction set is
gained. Moreover, pipeline design process has been simulated successfully, which involves 5 stages i.e.
instruction fetch (IF), instruction decode (ID), execution (EX), data memory (MEM) and write back (WB).
Further, to handle the pipeline hazard, separate instruction-memory and data-memory as well as some
hardware related to the forwarding technique have been designed.

The project is implemented using ModelSIM.
